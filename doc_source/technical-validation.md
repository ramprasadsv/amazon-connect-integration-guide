# Technical Validation Process<a name="technical-validation"></a>

The technical validation process for an Amazon Connect integration consists of providing AWS Solutions Architects with various documentation items, and code for review. This is typically followed by a scheduled meeting with the Solutions Architect where the partner will demonstrate the integration.

Generally, a question and answer session takes place during the demo and depending on the quality of the integration and information gathered from the demo and Q&A, iterations may be required.

The following items are `REQUIRED` for all integrations:

1. An architectural diagram illustrating the components and flow of the integration\.
    
   - It is recommended that you use [AWS Simple Icons](https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/icons/) for any architecture diagrams\. These are available as either a [Microsoft PowerPoint](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/awswebanddesign/Architecture+Icons/AWS-Arch-Icon-Sets_Oct-17/Powerpoint_17.10.18.zip) template or [EPS & SVG](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/awswebanddesign/Architecture+Icons/AWS-Arch-Icon-Sets_Oct-17/PNG%2C+SVG%2C+EPS_17.10.18.zip) formats\.
   - You may also use the sample [Quick Start Template](templates/Quick_Start_Template.pptx) template or the [Amazon Connect Integration Template](templates/AC_Integration_Template.pptx) template\.
1. A technical write-up of the integration\.
   - Please review examples published in the [Amazon Connect Integrations](https://aws.amazon.com/quickstart/connect/) Portal\. 
   - These be brief and provide a summary of how the integration adds value for the customer and what is included in the deployment\. 
1. A User Manual that covers installation and configuration of the integration\.
   - Please use the [Quick Start Style Guide](templates/Quick_Start_Style_Guide.docx)
1. A partner-hosted URL for each of the above documents which will be published in the landing page for your integration on the Amazon Connect Integrations Portal\.
1. Access to a live demo account or means to replicate provisioning of the integration components\.

Once all items have been received, tested, and approved, you will receive a launch date for your integration. This typically is followed by an announcement and press release\.

Optionally, we would be happy to promote your integration and would ask the following:

1. A draft blog entry for posting on [AWS Blogs](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws) showcasing your integration\.
1. Click-through video of your integration\.
1. Sizzle Reel & Battlecard\.
